% Due to directory permissions, saving MATLAB's path can be challenging. The
% front-end UI has been changed to make life a little easier. You no longer
% need to prepare QUATTRO's paths via the install/uninstall scripts. Instead,
% simply run "QUATTRO.m" from its parent directory, by adding that directory to
% MATLAB's path, or by using the "run" function. For example:
%
%   run('D:\Dropbox\Research\Software\QUATTRO\QUATTRO.m')
%
% initializes MATLAB's path and creates an instance of the QUATTRO GUI. If the
% GUI is not needed or undesired, then the file "qt_startup.m" can be run
% instead, which can be found in the same folder. For example:
%   run('D:\Dropbox\Research\Software\QUATTRO\qt_startup.m')
